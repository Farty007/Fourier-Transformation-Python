# Fourier-Transformation-Python
As a class project did a Fourier transformation for sound data. The task was to identify the dominant frequency in the data and also to get the SPL conversion from the Pascal values. 

due to files size restriction, I could not add the binary files named "CupData1.dat", "CupData2.dat", and "CupData3.dat". So, for your purposes, you can use your own csv or binary files, you just need to make sure the directory is the same and the names are correctly given in the code. 

For my code, you can check out the .html file after downloading to see the result. This is written in Jyupter Notebook but can easily be transferred to Python files if the necessary modules are already there.
